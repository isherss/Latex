	\section{Purpose}
    Familiarity with the behavior of resistors in both series and parallel configurations, as well as experimental verification of course material on series and parallel resistors. 

    \section{Materials} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Handheld Digital Multimeter (DMM)
        \item Breadboard
        \item Assorted Resistors (270$\Omega$, 330$\Omega$, and 510$\Omega$)
        \item Power Supply
        \item Wires
        \item Alligator Clips
    \end{itemize}


	\section{Theory}	
    In this lab, we make use of the \textbf{ammeter} function in our digital multimeters for the final section. The electrical current is measured in Amperes, which is one coulomb per second ($1.0 A = \frac{1.0C}{1.0 s}$).\\
    \vspace{5pt}
    Additionally, we made use of the most useful feature of a digital multimeter, being the \textbf{voltmeter}. With this mode, our multimeter is able to measure the potential difference between any two points with the units of volts ($\Delta V$), which gives us an idea of the difference in potential energy between two points in our circuit.\\ 
    \vspace{5pt}

    \textbf{Resistors} have the main property of "resistance", measured in Ohms ($\Omega$), which can be thought of as a ratio of Volts over Amperes, or how many volts will be dropped across the resistor for a certain amount of current. Each resistor generally has 4-6 colored bands printed onto them, which indicate the value of its resistance. All but the last two colored bands indicate numbers in decimal increments, the second to last indicates a multiplier, and the last band indicates the tolerance of the resistor with either a silver or gold band. \\ 
    \vspace{5pt}

    A \textbf{Breadboard} is a useful tool for prototyping small electric circuits, as it lets you consistently connect electrical components together without need for wire nuts or soldering. A breadboard is essentially a grid of termination points, with rows of these points connected together. Using this principle, one row of a standard breadboard can electrically connect 5 different components together in order to make more complex circuits.

    \end{figure} 


    \subsection*{Resistors in series}
        $$R_{eq} = R_1 +R_2 + R_3 $$
        The total Voltage across resistors in series is equal to the sum of voltage drops across each subsequent resistor. $$ V_{eq} = \varepsilon = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 = I R_1 + I R_2 + I R_3 $$

    \subsection*{Resistors in parallel} 
        $$R_{eq} = \left( \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \frac{1}{R_2} \right)  $$
        The voltage drop across each resistor in a parallel setup is equal to the potential difference of the battery $\varepsilon$.
        $$V_{eq} = \varepsilon = V_1 = V_2 = V_3 $$


	\section{Experiment Analysis}
    When we have resistors in parallel, the potential difference across them are the same.

	\section{Purpose}
	To study the relationship between electric field and the electric potential difference associated with it.
	\section{Theory}	
	The relationship between the electric field and electric potential difference will follow the equation \(\Delta V = -\int_{a}^{b} \vec{E} \cdot ds\), which simplified is \(\Delta V = \frac{k_{e}q}{r}\). This means electric potential will have a opposite yet linear relationship with the electric field, while having an inverse relationship with distance.
	\section{Experiment Analysis}
	\section{Procedure}
    The experiment is begun by "drawing" the patterns used for the experiments on the conductive surface using conductive ink. This step was performed by our instructor beforehand. 
    \subsection{Perimeter of Conductive Ink and Point Charge}
    The configuration of electrodes below was used for this first part of the experiment. The small circular electrode (white dot) at the center was held at 10 Volts. The green dots indicate where the voltages were measured. 7 points were taking from each side of the positive electrode.
